"""Question 1:
Git is categorized as a distributed version control system.

Question 2:
An example of a code hosting service that utilizes Git is GitHub.

Question 3:
Git files can exist in three different states:

Modified state: This occurs when a file has undergone changes but has not yet been committed to the repository.
Staged state: In this state, the changes made to a modified file have been marked to be included in the next commit.
Committed state: Files in this state have had their changes permanently saved in the Git repository.

Question 4:
In the realm of Git, PR stands for Pull Request. A Pull Request is a mechanism used to propose changes to a codebase hosted in 
a Git repository. It enables contributors to suggest modifications, additions, or bug fixes, which are then subjected to review and 
potential integration into the main codebase.

"Repo" is an abbreviation for "repository." A repository serves as a centralized storage location in Git, housing all the files, history,
and branches of a project. It functions as the primary container for code and associated information.

Question 5:
The git command that updates the local repository with changes from the remote repository is git pull.
It fetches the changes from the remote repository and merges them with the current branch in the local repository.

Question 6: The git command that gets the changes from the remote repository but doesn't update the local repository is git fetch. 
The command downloads the latest changes from the remote repository, including all branches and their respective commits. 
However, it does not merge these changes into the current branch. It is useful for inspecting the changes before deciding 
to incorporate them into the local repository.

Question 7: The git command that updates the remote repository with local repository code is git push. It is used to send committed changes 
from the local repository to the remote repository. It updates the remote repository with the latest commits made on the local branch.

Question 8: To work properly, the git commit command needs two things:
Modified or staged files: The files that you want to include in the commit need to be in either the modified or staged state. This means 
they have been changed or marked for inclusion using the git add command. 

A commit message: The commit command requires a descriptive message that explains the changes made in the commit. The message should be meaningful and concise, providing an overview of the modifications made in the commit.
